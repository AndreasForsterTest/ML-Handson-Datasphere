# Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces

## Introduction

In this guide, you'll create a codespace from this repository and explore some essential features available within the codespace. You'll work in the browser version of Visual Studio Code, which is initially the default editor for GitHub Codespaces and as well the basis for *SAP Business Application Studio*.

<br> Why do I need a codespace? Use a preconfigured development environment - You can work in a development environment that has been specifically configured for the repository. It will have all of the tools, languages, and configurations you need to work on that project. So the Python code will be excecuted in the codespace which will trigger the machine learning capabilities in *SAP Datasphere*. 

## Creating Your Codespace

1. Navigate to the `https://github.com/YOUR_USER/ML-Handson-Datasphere` repository.
2. Click **Code**, then click **Codespaces** and then the link under *on current branch*, probably called "main"
3. A codespace for the repository will open up, on the left you'll find your files, forked in the step before, for use in the hands-on exercises.
4. On the file explorer on the left go to >  exercises > LucerneElectricity.csv and download the file with a right click on the file "Download ..."
5. Leave the codespace open and switch to [main description (README.md](../README.md) in a new tab where you'll start with exercises.

## You're good-to-go! 

Continue with the excercises under [main description (README.md](../README.md)
